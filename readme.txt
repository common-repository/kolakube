3. Done! This plugin doesn't do anything by itself, and is required for [Page Leads](http://kolakube.com/marketers-delight/#page-leads)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is this? =

From a functionality standpoint, this plugin serves as the base for all admin-side settings pages and options for Kolakube [Page Leads plugins](http://kolakube.com/marketers-delight/#page-leads) and the [Marketers Delight](http://kolakube.com/marketers-delight/) theme. Itâ€™s like an options framework.

This plugin is the base of my current and future work at Kolakube and is part of an experiment in modular theme development.

Documentation and other plans coming soon.

== Screenshots ==

1. The Featured Image enhancement meta box. Requires a theme that supports it.
